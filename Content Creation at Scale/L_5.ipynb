Cutting by 25 basis points still keeps the federal funds rate restrictive, but not as restrictive as it was,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.\"Elections have consequences and we could see a marginal improvement in growth relative to their forecasts, but also a marginal increase in inflation relative to their forecasts. That would call for a more gradual pace of rate reductions.\"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI), opens new tab fell 0.59 point, or flat, to 43,729.34, the S&P 500 (.SPX), opens new tab gained 44.06 points, or 0.74%, to 5,973.10 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC), opens new tab gained 285.99 points, or 1.51%, to 19,269.46.Communications services (.SPLRCL), opens new tab, up 1.92%, led S&P sector gains, buoyed by a jump of 11.81% in Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O), opens new tab after a surprise third-quarter profit.Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), after Republican Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, in New York City, U.S., November 6, 2024.

JP Morgan (JPM.N), opens new tab lost 4.32% and Goldman Sachs (GS.N), opens new tab shares shed 2.32% to weigh on the Dow.Expectations for continued rate cuts have been dialed back recently, however, as economic data continues to point to a resilient economy and the potential for higher inflation as a result of likely tariffs and increased government spending under Trump's administration.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said no decision has been made on what sort of policy action the central bank will take in December but the central bank is \"prepared to adjust our assessment of the appropriate pace and destination‚Äù for monetary policy amid uncertainty.Investors are also eying whether Republicans could win control of both houses of Congress, making it easier for Trump's agenda to proceed.Treasury yields, which have surged in recent weeks, retreated after a sharp rise on Wednesday, as the benchmark 10-year yield eased from a four-month high of 4.479%, before briefly paring declines slightly after the Fed statement and were last at 4.332%.Data earlier on Thursday showed U.S. weekly jobless claims rose marginally last week, suggesting no material change in labor market conditions.A column chart titled \"US unemployment claims\" that tracks the metric over a recent period. The number of people filing new claims increased to 221,000 in the most recent week.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.94-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.18-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P 500 posted 56 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 193 new highs and 88 new lows.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 16.78 billion shares, compared with the 12.46 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

      "**Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, the US stock market has been significantly impacted by inflation, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite experiencing fluctuations in response to changing inflation rates. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been a key indicator of inflation, and its changes have influenced investor sentiment and market trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recent Developments:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* On October 10, 2024, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped after a higher-than-expected inflation report, with the CPI increasing 2.4% over the prior year in September.\n",
      "* Despite this, consumer confidence bounced back in October, with 51.4% of consumers expecting stock prices to increase over the year ahead.\n",
      "* The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported a drop in inflation to 2.4% in September from 2.5%, bringing it to a three-year low.\n",
      "* Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on October 10, 2024, as investors looked to higher-than-expected inflation and unemployment data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Inflation remains a significant concern for investors, with the CPI still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.\n",
      "* The recent increase in inflation has clouded the picture for a potential Fed rate cut, with investors awaiting further commentary from the central bank.\n",
      "* Despite the challenges posed by inflation, consumer confidence remains strong, with many investors expecting stock prices to increase in the year ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investment Outlook:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Vanguard's investment and economic outlook for October 2024 suggests that the year-over-year pace of core inflation will fall to about 2.5% by year-end 2024.\n",
      "* Ellevest's analysis of the inflation data suggests that while inflation may be easing, it remains a significant problem for investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the US stock market has been significantly impacted by inflation in 2024, with fluctuations in response to changing inflation rates. While consumer confidence remains strong, investors should remain cautious and monitor inflation data closely in the coming months.\u001b[00m\n",

      "**US Inflation News 2024 and Stock Market Impact Report**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The US stock market has been significantly impacted by inflation in 2024, with fluctuations in response to changing inflation rates. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been a key indicator of inflation, and its changes have influenced investor sentiment and market trends. While inflation remains a concern, consumer confidence remains strong, and many investors expect stock prices to increase in the year ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recent Developments:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped after a higher-than-expected inflation report, with the CPI increasing 2.4% over the prior year in September.\n",
      "* Consumer confidence bounced back in October, with 51.4% of consumers expecting stock prices to increase over the year ahead.\n",
      "* The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported a drop in inflation to 2.4% in September from 2.5%, bringing it to a three-year low.\n",
      "* Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on October 10, 2024, as investors looked to higher-than-expected inflation and unemployment data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Inflation remains a significant concern for investors, with the CPI still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.\n",
      "* The recent increase in inflation has clouded the picture for a potential Fed rate cut, with investors awaiting further commentary from the central bank.\n",
      "* Despite the challenges posed by inflation, consumer confidence remains strong, with many investors expecting stock prices to increase in the year ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investment Outlook:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Vanguard's investment and economic outlook for October 2024 suggests that the year-over-year pace of core inflation will fall to about 2.5% by year-end 2024.\n",
      "* Ellevest's analysis of the inflation data suggests that while inflation may be easing, it remains a significant problem for investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact of Inflation on Stock Market Performance:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Inflation can distort how we perceive market gains, with nominal stock market gains since 2021 showing an increase of 39%, but shrinking to just 15% when adjusted for inflation.\n",
      "* Inflation can affect the stock market, including the potential for inflated gains, changes in market sentiment, and the impact of inflation on sector performance.\n",
      "* The S&P 500 has repeatedly reached new record highs in 2024, but some experts warn that the market may be due for a correction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the US stock market has been significantly impacted by inflation in 2024, with fluctuations in response to changing inflation rates. While consumer confidence remains strong, investors should remain cautious and monitor inflation data closely in the coming months. The impact of inflation on stock market performance is complex, and investors should consider adjusting their investment strategies to account for the potential effects of inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations for Content Creation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Create informative articles and videos about the impact of inflation on the stock market, highlighting the latest trends and data.\n",
      "* Develop social media campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of considering inflation when making investment decisions.\n",
      "* Produce in-depth analysis and commentary on the potential effects of inflation on sector performance and individual stocks.\n",
      "* Offer webinars and online courses to educate investors about the impact of inflation on their investment portfolios and provide strategies for mitigating its effects.\u001b[00m\n",

      "outlook. In this scenario, continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions cause inflation to stay higher for longer, driving the Federal Reserve to hike rates.1 Scenarios Baseline (70%): Real GDP growth slowed overall in the first quarter of 2024, coming in very close to our previous forecast‚Äôs expectations.2 We expect GDP growth will continue to moderate through the second half of this year and the start of the next, but the story is still positive overall. Consumer spending is forecasted to rise 2.3% this year, up from the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, down from 4.5% last year. Government spending is forecasted to rise 2.5%. Given that the US economy is expected to outperform many other global economies in the short term, we forecast imports to increase 3.1% on average in 2024, while exports are predicted to rise at a slower pace of 2.4%. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the second quarter of this year before falling to 2.7% by the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve succeeds in walking the tightrope to a soft landing by cutting rates twice in the second half of 2024 and continues with cuts until reaching the neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027. Job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable, given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate falls in the short term, but rises to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a boost to manufacturing.3 In addition, investments in intellectual property‚Äîsuch as the use of AI and other novel technologies‚Äîwill continue to drive growth in the business sector. Overall, we expect the US economy to post real GDP growth of 2.4% this year, but for growth to slow to 1.1% in 2025. Between 2026 and 2028, economic growth is expected to pick back up, with annual gains in\n",

       "- **Sector Performance**: Inflation can distort perceptions of market gains. For instance, nominal increases in stock market indices since 2021 reflect a robust growth of *39%*, but when adjusted for inflation, these gains dwindle to only *15%*. Sectors like technology have achieved new highs; however, experts warn that inevitable corrections may be on the horizon as inflation continues to influence performance. In contrast, value stocks and those in essential services tend to hold more stable positions during turbulent economic cycles.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Economic Outlook**: Leading economic forecasts suggest that while the core inflation rate may stabilize at around *2.5%* by the end of 2024, other factors such as geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions could elongate high inflation periods. Thus, maintaining a diversified investment strategy remains essential for navigating this volatility. Investors should be prepared for continued fluctuations and potentially position their portfolios accordingly.\n",
